# tvc
**tandem version control** is a simple Python library for combining 
[git](https://git-scm.com/) and [dvc](https://dvc.org/) commands that 
are typically issued in tandem.


## Prerequisites

Since tvc is just a simple wrapper, you need to make sure that the following
are installed on your system and their executables are available from the
PATH environment variable:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [dvc](https://dvc.org/)


## Installation

Via PyPI:

```bash
pip install tvc
```

The latest code straight from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fracpete/tvc.git
```
